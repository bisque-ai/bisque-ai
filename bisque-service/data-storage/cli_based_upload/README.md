# Data Upload from CLI

This section helps users to seamlessly upload their images from a command line interface (CLI). Uploading huge datasets from the web interface is not reliable for various reasons (e.g: Discontinued Network Connectivity, Need to have Users workstation to be active for longer durations, and so on). In these scenarios, our CLI comes super handy.


Stay tuned for the detailed documentation on our CLI! Meanwhile, one can checkout more about iRODS and gocommands at [https://github.com/cyverse/gocommands](https://github.com/cyverse/gocommands).
