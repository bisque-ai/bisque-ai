# Data Upload from CLI

This section helps users seamlessly upload their images from a command-line interface (CLI). Uploading huge datasets from the web browser is not reliable for various reasons (e.g., discontinued network connectivity, need to have Users workstations be active for longer duration, and so on). In these scenarios, our CLI comes super handy.

Stay tuned for the detailed documentation on our CLI! Meanwhile, one can checkout more about iRODS and gocommands at [https://github.com/cyverse/gocommands](https://github.com/cyverse/gocommands).
