# CellECT 2.0

## Plant Cell Segmentation

### Overview&#x20;

This module is for segmenting 3D membrane tagged cell images. The workflow is as follows: 3D UNet to output the probability map of a cell boundary, 3D watershed to get the initial cell label, and 3D Conditional Random Field (CRF) to refine the segmentation label.

### **Algorithm Workflow Diagram**&#x20;

By using 3D UNET on the backend, we are able to segment the 3D volumes of the cells. We then create the segmentation map and use a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to further refine the segmentation map. Lastly, we use the information from the algorithm to extract features about the cells such as volume, surface coordinates, and many others.

### **Module Integration Workflow**&#x20;

The module workflow consists of a source code folder with information on how to run the algorithm. We can then Dockerize the source code folder using a base image that includes the necessary CUDA libraries and dependencies and beginning testing whther the source code runs inside the container. Thereafter, we deploy the module on BisQue for public usage.

### Input&#x20;

* `TIFF Image` with minimum $$z > 1$$â€‹

#### Hyperparameters&#x20;

* `Threshold` - The bilateral standard deviation (threshold) for CRF define how much intensity-homogeneity is required within a region. Higher values allow greater variations under the same label.
* `Label Threshold` - The minimum possible volume of cells to avoid segmenting intercellular space as an individual cell.
* `Minimum Distance` - In the seeds detection for watershed, the minimum possible distance between two seeds. The lower the value is, the more likely to have over-segmentation.
* `Minimum Cell Size` - Minimum size to be considered a cell

#### Cell Features&#x20;

* `Cell Number` - The number of cells in each image stack.
* `Cell Volume` - The size of each cell in terms of number of voxels.
* `Cell Center` - The centroid of each cell.
* `Cell Coordinates` - The surface coordinate of each cell.
* `Adjacency Table` - The graph represents the neighbor of each cell
* `3-way Conjunction Points` - The touch points of 3 neighboring cells

### Output&#x20;

* `Segmented TIFF Image`
